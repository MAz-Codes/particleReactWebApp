# particleReactWebApp

## Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to the repository of my personal web application built using React. This project is a true reflection of my passions and skills, seamlessly integrating particle animations, multi-language capabilities, and aesthetic themes. Here, you'll also get a glimpse of my music, videos, research endeavors, and ways to contact me, as this web app also works as my personal portfolio!

## Features I've Incorporated

### Particle Animations:

I've devised three distinct particle systems – Web particle, NewPageParticle, and SecondNewPageParticles – to provide a visually engaging backdrop and some fun interactivity.

### Multi-Language Support:

Recognizing the global nature of the web, I've integrated the app with react-i18next to support English, German, and Farsi.

### Theme Toggle:

I understand the love for both light and dark modes. Hence, I've added a toggle switch that also respects system preferences.

### Dynamic Display:

My app morphs according to user interactions, presenting my music, video, research, and contact sections in an engaging manner.

### Cookie Banner:

I care about your privacy, so I've added a cookie consent banner that remembers your preferences.

### Responsive Design:

I've made sure the app provides an equally immersive experience on both mobile and desktop devices. Plus, it's adaptive to window resizing.

### Intuitive Navigation:

I've embraced FontAwesome icons for a richer user experience, and there's a neat hamburger menu for mobile views.
